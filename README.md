# The-Covid-Project
This data analytics project employed SQL and Tableau for exploring and analyzing global Covid-19 data. The data went through thorough cleaning and transformation using SQL to ensure high data quality. Visualizations were then produced in Tableau, allowing us to identify key global trends and variations in country-level responses to the pandemic.

To provide a detailed analysis, we developed a time-series graph for select countries to highlight the percentage of population infected over time, while also predicting future infection rates.

The results of our analysis are presented through interactive dashboards, which allow individuals to explore the data and make informed decisions about their personal health and safety. 

We express our gratitude to the World Health Organization for openly sharing the data used in this analysis, as well as Our World in Data for consistently updating this dataset and making it openly available to all.
